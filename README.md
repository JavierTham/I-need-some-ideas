# I-need-some-ideas
Creative juices aren't flowing 24/7, since I can't generate ideas on my own, why not let the computer do it for me?

## Problem
It might be difficult to think of topics for projects, or choose among the thousands of notebooks/papers/blogs to read from.

## Solution
Kaggle has many datasets to explore and well written code to learn from. I can pick a dataset/notebook randomly from there.
